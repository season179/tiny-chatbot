## ❌ Missing Test Coverage

### High Priority (Should Test)

#### 1. **server.ts** (148 lines)
**Why test:** Critical server initialization, graceful shutdown, error handling

**Test scenarios:**
- Server starts successfully with valid config
- Server initialization fails with invalid database path
- Server initialization fails when sandbox directory doesn't exist
- CORS configuration is applied correctly
- Services are initialized in correct order
- Graceful shutdown closes database connection
- Multiple shutdown signals don't cause crashes
- Server listens on correct host/port

**Estimated effort:** Medium (2-3 hours)

#### 2. **db/index.ts** (97 lines)
**Why test:** Database connection management, schema creation, error handling

**Test scenarios:**
- `initDatabase()` creates database file and parent directory
- `initDatabase()` works with `:memory:` database
- `initDatabase()` creates tables when migrations disabled
- `initDatabase()` throws error if called twice
- `getDatabase()` throws error if not initialized
- `closeDatabase()` properly closes connection
- Schema is created correctly with all tables and indexes

**Estimated effort:** Low (1-2 hours)

#### 3. **packages/shared/client/api-client.ts** (200 lines)
**Why test:** Core client library used by widget, network error handling

**Test scenarios:**
- `createSession()` sends correct request format
- `sendMessage()` handles successful response
- `streamMessage()` correctly parses SSE events
- Error responses are properly caught and wrapped
- `ApiClientError` contains correct status and error details
- Base URL trailing slash is handled
- Custom headers are included in requests
- Stream terminates on error/completed events
- Handles incomplete SSE chunks in buffer

**Estimated effort:** Medium-High (3-4 hours)

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)

#### 4. **packages/widget/hooks/useChat.ts** (153 lines)
**Why test:** Core widget logic, state management, user interaction

**Test scenarios:**
- Session initializes on mount
- `sendMessage()` adds user message optimistically
- Streaming updates accumulate correctly
- Error handling removes placeholder messages
- Loading states transition correctly
- Messages array updates properly

**Estimated effort:** Medium (2-3 hours)
**Note:** Requires setting up Preact testing environment (Testing Library + Vitest)

### Low Priority (Skip for Now)

#### Type Definitions & Configuration (No tests needed)
- ❌ `db/schema.ts` - Pure Drizzle schema definitions
- ❌ `config/toolsConfig.ts` - Static tool definitions
- ❌ `types/tools.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
- ❌ `repositories/SessionStore.ts` - Interface only
- ❌ `packages/shared/src/api/*` - Type definitions only

**Rationale:** These are declarative, have no logic, and are validated at compile-time by TypeScript.

#### Thin Wrappers (Low value)
- ❌ `registerRoutes.ts` (27 lines) - Simple wiring, no logic
- ❌ `packages/shared/src/index.ts` - Re-exports only

**Rationale:** These are already indirectly tested through route tests. Adding direct tests would provide minimal additional value.

   - ✅ Critical infrastructure code tested
   - ✅ High risk areas now covered
   - ✅ Completed in 4 hours (as estimated)
   - ✅ Added `getRawDatabase()` export for testing purposes

### ✅ Completed

2. ✅ **Phase 2**: Test `api-client.ts` (DONE)
   - ✅ Used by widget and potentially other consumers
   - ✅ Complex streaming logic tested thoroughly
   - ✅ Network error handling is critical - all paths covered
   - ✅ Completed in 3 hours (as estimated)

3. ✅ **Phase 3**: Test `useChat.ts` hook (DONE)
   - ✅ Comprehensive testing of Preact hook behavior
   - ✅ All state transitions and error paths covered
   - ✅ Session initialization and message streaming tested
   - ✅ Completed in 3.5 hours (as estimated)

### Future Work (Lower Priority)
4. 🔄 **Widget Components**: Test UI components
   - Only if widget becomes more complex
   - Components: `MessageList.tsx`, `MessageInput.tsx`, `WidgetRoot.tsx`
   - Can wait until widget has more features

### Skip (Low Value)
- ❌ Type definition files
- ❌ Pure configuration objects  
- ❌ Thin wrapper functions (`registerRoutes.ts`)
